Design: The goal of the game is to drive a car and reach the end of the track as fast as possible, but due to the rain, the road is quite slippery, and there are many obstacles on the way. What is the best time you can achieve?

How To Play:

The car is controlled using WASD. The faster the car moves (speed can be seen on top left of the screen), the more slippery the controls are. There is a timer running at the top right of the screen keeping track of how much time you are taking to complete the course. Your goal is to achieve the minimum time possible.
